Weekly, youth will participate in a studio session to learn about the fabrication or repurposing process and materials required to create the outlined fashion. Then they will have time to design and fabric their own fashion to be modeled in the fashion show. We will utilize wearable technology, tulle, and fabric dye as well as learn how to hand sew and repurpose materials. The youth will be students of the fashion industry, learning about different career options as well as common terms and tools of the industry. Our goal is to use Homewood and adjacent neighborhoods as a campus for youth to expose youth to out-of-school environments that support their creative interest. To do weekly studio sessions will be hosted various locations and fashion show will be at Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh - Homewood Auditorium. This year our theme \"Reclaim & Remix\" to support we have collaborated with Pittsburgh Center for Creative Reuse to promote resource conservation and creativity through material reuse. Studio sessions will: June 27, July 11, 18, 25, August 1, 8, 15 and 22 ",

The project drew contributions from thousands of people worldwide and received tremendous attention from the media with no traditional advertising expense. The campaign resulted in a 46% increase in apparel sales for Livestrong.\n\nPart monstrosity, part artistry, the Chalkbot relied on adaptation and \u00e2\u0080\u0098gutter technology\u00e2\u0080\u0099. Built in seven weeks by our small artist-led team, the Chalkbot\u00e2\u0080\u0099s brain was an off-the-shelf notebook computer and its spray guns are typically used to paint lines on roadways. The typographic tool that we used to build custom font sets was nothing more than a grid of check boxes on a web page. Every component was reinterpreted. This collapsing of buzz-worthy tech with old-school encoder wheels, trailer cranks, and toothbrushes (used to keep the spray nozzles clean) led to the Chalkbot\u00e2\u0080\u0099s success and intrigue.\n\nChalkbot swept advertising industry award shows internationally; among other achievements, it was named one of the 10 Best Digital Campaigns of the Decade by the One Club.",

The project began in 2006 as Robot Diaries, which aimed to create an after school engineering and robotics activity that could appeal to middle school girls as much as or more than to boys. Initial pilots with groups of girls, followed by an expanded focus that included both boys and girls as well as teachers and in-school curricula led to a renaming of the project to Arts and Bots and a focus on creating curricula and technologies that integrate arts and crafts with engineering education. The Hummingbird as well as the CREATE Lab's Visual Programmer (the environment used by students to program Hummingbird) have co-evolved with the Arts and Bots program, and will continue to do so. As the core technologies of the Arts and Bots program became more stable and usable, parents, teachers, and administrators began asking if they could purchase additional Hummingbirds or steer their colleagues or friends to a vendor. We're happy to be releasing Hummingbird commercially under license from Carnegie Mellon, making this fantastic robotics kit widely available and allowing the Arts and Bots research program to grow and scale without the constraint of being responsible for manufacturing and distributing a commercial product.",

Once you have the basic outline, then you'll learn how to make your characters and plot come alive with powerful, descriptive writing, figurative language, and original and accurate details. In-class exercises and brief out-of-class excursions will focus on three key areas: How to make characters memorable; how to create distinct settings; and how to describe awesome action sequences. Over the course of this three-day summer camp, teenagers develop a complete fiction story, and workshop it just as the pros do. Forget flat, one-dimensional fiction and give your readers a story that will stick with them long after they read the last page!",
